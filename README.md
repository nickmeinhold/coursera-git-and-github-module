# Simple Interest Calculator

A simple interest calculator that computes the interest earned on a principal amount over a specified time period.

## Description

This project provides a basic tool for calculating simple interest. Simple interest is a quick method of calculating the interest charge on a loan or investment based on the original principal amount.

## Formula

Simple Interest is calculated using the following formula:
```
SI = P × R × T / 100
```

Where:
- **SI** = Simple Interest
- **P** = Principal amount (the initial sum of money)
- **R** = Rate of interest per annum (in percentage)
- **T** = Time period (in years)

## Example

If you invest $1,000 at an annual interest rate of 5% for 3 years:
```
SI = 1000 × 5 × 3 / 100 = $150
```

The total amount after 3 years would be: $1,000 + $150 = **$1,150**

## Usage

1. Input the principal amount
2. Input the annual interest rate (as a percentage)
3. Input the time period in years
4. The calculator returns the simple interest earned
